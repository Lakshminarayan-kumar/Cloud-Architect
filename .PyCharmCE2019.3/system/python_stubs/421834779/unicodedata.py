This module provides access to the Unicode Character Database which
defines character properties for all Unicode characters. The data in
this database is based on the UnicodeData.txt file version
5.2.0 which is publically available from ftp://ftp.unicode.org/.

The module uses the same names and symbols as defined by the
UnicodeData File Format 5.2.0 (see
http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/tr44-4.html).
