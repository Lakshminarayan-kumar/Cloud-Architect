"""
This module defines an object type which can efficiently represent
an array of basic values: characters, integers, floating point
numbers.  Arrays are sequence types and behave very much like lists,
except that the type of objects stored in them is constrained.  The
type is specified at object creation time by using a type code, which
is a single character.  The following type codes are defined:

    Type code   C Type             Minimum size in bytes 
    'c'         character          1 
    'b'         signed integer     1 
    'B'         unsigned integer   1 
    'u'         Unicode character  2 
    'h'         signed integer     2 
    'H'         unsigned integer   2 
    'i'         signed integer     2 
    'I'         unsigned integer   2 
    'l'         signed integer     4 
    'L'         unsigned integer   4 
    'f'         floating point     4 
    'd'         floating point     8 

The constructor is:

    array(typecode [, initializer]) -> array
    
    Return a new array whose items are restricted by typecode, and
    initialized from the optional initializer value, which must be a list,
    string or iterable over elements of the appropriate type.
    
    Arrays represent basic values and behave very much like lists, except
    the type of objects stored in them is constrained.
    
    Methods:
    
    append() -- append a new item to the end of the array
    buffer_info() -- return information giving the current memory info
    byteswap() -- byteswap all the items of the array
    count() -- return number of occurrences of an object
    extend() -- extend array by appending multiple elements from an iterable
    fromfile() -- read items from a file object
    fromlist() -- append items from the list
    fromstring() -- append items from the string
    index() -- return index of first occurrence of an object
    insert() -- insert a new item into the array at a provided position
    pop() -- remove and return item (default last)
    read() -- DEPRECATED, use fromfile()
    remove() -- remove first occurrence of an object
    reverse() -- reverse the order of the items in the array
    tofile() -- write all items to a file object
    tolist() -- return the array converted to an ordinary list
    tostring() -- return the array converted to a string
    write() -- DEPRECATED, use tofile()
    
    Attributes:
    
    typecode -- the typecode character used to create the array
